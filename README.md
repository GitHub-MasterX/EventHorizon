# EventHorizon

**EventHorizon** is an open-source framework for deploying and analyzing multiprotocol IoT tarpits.  
It provides a modular, containerized environment where each protocol emulator runs inside its own Docker container, 
and all telemetry data is collected and visualized through a Prometheus + Grafana stack.

### 🌌 Why the name *EventHorizon*?
In astrophysics, the *event horizon* is the boundary around a black hole beyond which nothing can escape.  
Similarly, the **EventHorizon** framework acts as a boundary for malicious network activity:  
once an automated scanner crosses into it, the connection cannot progress or escape—it becomes trapped indefinitely.  
This captures the essence of what the framework does: slowing, containing, and observing automated attacks without letting them spread.
